## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive ROI selection**  
  Draw square sampling windows (512√ó512 pixels) directly on a Sentinel-2 map notebook.
- **Auto-save ROIs**  
  Each region is saved as a shapefile with center coordinates, acquisition date, and geometry.
- **Batch Sentinel-2 download**  
  Automatically fetches the first 12 bands (B1‚ÄìB12, excluding B10) for each ROI and acquisition date, clipped to the drawn window.
- **Visualization**  
  Display downloaded TIFFs and ROI boundaries on an interactive map within your notebook.
- **Cloud, snow, and date handling**  
  Seamlessly filters imagery based on cloud and snow coverage, and handles date selection logic.
